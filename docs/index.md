## Open San Diego + Friends

Welcome to the Team page for the [BigDataForSanDiego 2019](https://bigdataforsandiego.github.io) team "Open San Diego + Friends", a collaboration between [Open San Diego](https://opensandiego.org) brigade volunteers and SDSU students.

Our theme and forthcoming hack will be: 

> Using data analysis to determine and characterize transit needs for the elderly and mobility impaired

> Then communicating the availability of needs of transit to the affected population and policy makers
